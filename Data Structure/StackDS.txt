Stack Data Structure

Stack is a linear data structure which operates in a LIFO (Last In First Out)
or FILO (First In Last Out) pattern.

- It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, 
for example - a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.

- Stack is an abstract data type with a bounded (predefined) capacity.

- It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements
in a particular order.

- The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

Working of Stack 

Stack Data Structure operates in a LIFO (Last In First Out) pattern or
FILO (First In Last Out) pattern.

>> Items are added on top of the stack. This is known as PUSH operation.
>> Items are removed from top of the stack. This is known as POP operation.

Standard Stack Operations -

1) push()
Place an item onto the stack. If there is not place for new item, 
stack is in overflow state.

2) pop()
Return the item at the top of the stack and then remove it.
If pop is called when stack is empty, it is in underflow state.

3) isEmpty()
Tells if the statck is empty or not.

4) isFull()
Tells if the stack is full or not.

5) peek()
Access the item at the i position.

6) count()
Get the number of items in the stack.

7) change()
Change the item at the i position.

8) display()
Display all items in the stack.

Application of Stack Data Structure

- Balancing of symbols. e.g {}, [] opening and closing symbols.

- Infix to Postfix / Prefix conversion.

- Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.

- Forward and backward features in web browsers.

- Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock 
span problem, hsitogram problem.

- Other applications can be Backtracking, Knight tour problem, rat in a 
maze, N queen problem and sudoku solver.

- In Graph algorithms like Topological Sorting and Strongly Connected 
Components.
