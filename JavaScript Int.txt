1) What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

- Object literal syntax:
a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.
 
var object = {
     name: "Sudheer",
     age: 34
};

- Object constructor:
var object = Object();
The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.
This pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects.
var object = Object.create(null);
